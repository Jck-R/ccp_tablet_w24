            <h2>Double Chocolate Cookies</h2>
            <img src="images/double_chocolate_cookies.png" width="400" alt="Chocolate cookies">

            <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to
                fit the taste buds of her siblings. They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it. Note,
                these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

            <h2>Double Chocolate Chips</h2>
            <img src="images/double_chocolate_chips.png" width="400" alt="Chocolate chips">

            <p>This is a tried-and-tested recipe that I have used numerous times for making the perfect chocolate chip
                banana bread! Not only does it help utilize the bananas that have slowly overripened at the back of the
                fridge, it ends up creating an incredibly delicious, and relatively healthy, dessert.</p>

            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cooking spray</li>
                <li>2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>

                </li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, mix egg, egg yolk, granulated sugar, butter, sour cream, and vanilla. Add bananas
                    and stir until combined. Gradually add dry ingredients to banana mixture until just combined.</li>

            <h2>Margherita Pizza</h2>
            <img src="images/pizza.jpeg" width="400" alt="Pizza">

            <p>Margherita pizza gets its name from Queen Margherita of Savoy, who was the Queen consort of Umberto I. It
                was once during her visit to Naples that the dish came into being.</p>

            <p>A traditional Neapolitan Margherita pizza recipe is tomato sauce with fresh tomatoes, mozzarella cheese
                and basil which represent the colours of the Italian flag – white cheese, green basil and red tomato.
            </p>

            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine water and yeast. Let stand 5 minutes. Add flour, salt, and oil and stir
                    until a sticky dough forms. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 6
                    minutes. Shape into a ball, place in a large bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm
                    place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 500°. Punch down dough and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Roll out into a
                    12” circle and transfer to a lightly greased pizza pan. Spread sauce over dough, leaving a 1”
                    border, then top with mozzarella. Bake until crust is golden and cheese is melted and bubbling,
                    about 15 minutes. Top with basil before serving.</li>
